Tipsy Bartender Web App

Description:
Tipsy Bartender allows a user to enter the name of an adult beverage (either alcohol type or actual drink name) and they are given a picture of the drink, ingredients, and instructions to recreate the masterpiece. This project incorporates a REST API, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a little bit of Adobe Photoshop. You can access this project live at https://www.tbartender.netlify.app. Or if you would like to take it up a notch, feel free to fork the repository and create your own magic. I hope you enjoy!

Optimizations:
I was able to on in a reduce javascript code increasing performance and SEO. Would like to learn Bootstrap and eventually add an image carousel.

Lessons Learned:
A lot of block chains and fetch requests can greatly reduce the speed in a web app. For future reference, will continue to learn ways to reduce code for better speed and performance.
